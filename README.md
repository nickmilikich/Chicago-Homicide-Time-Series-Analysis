This project is an analysis of the monthly rate of homicides in Chicago from January 2001 through September 2019, and an attempt to identify and characterize any trends and forecast future rates for purposes of planning and resource allocation. The data are taken from the Chicago Police Departmentâ€™s Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting system. It was completed to fulfill the requirements for ACMS 40842 Time Series Analysis at the University of Notre Dame.

The project is contained in Group1_Report_Rcodes.R, and can be run by simply executing this one file. Also included in this repository are Group1_Report.pdf and Group1_Presentation.pptx, which are fuller reports on the methodology and conclusions of this analysis.

Running this code requires that the R packages fpp2, fpp, and forecast be installed.

To run the source code, the following should be included in the same directory (included in this repository):
- Homicides (1).csv
- Temperature.txt

This project was run using R version 4.0.3.
